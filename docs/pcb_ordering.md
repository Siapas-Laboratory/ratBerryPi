# Guidelines For PCB Ordering
Our manufacturer of choice for all PCB's to date has been JLCPCB. The manufacturing files provided are geared towards a smooth checkout process through JLCPCB. There are 2 types of PCBs that need to be built for this project: the interface PCB and the module PCB. Our recommendation is to get as much of the interface PCB assembled by JLCPCB as possible because there are many components and many of them are surface mount. The module PCBs on the other hand can be assembled as needed, and as such it should be sufficient (and more cost effective) to order these boards unassembled and solder the components to them yourself.
